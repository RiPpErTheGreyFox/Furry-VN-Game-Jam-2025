Furry Visual Novel Game Jam 2025

Platform:
Gameboy/Color Gameboy

Optional Theme: 
Retro (should be nailing it with the gameboy and 90's IRC aesthetic)

Engine/Software used:
Custom GBZ80 engine, using RGBDS assembler
Aseprite - Art
NEXXT - Art
hUGETracker - Music

Schedule:
12 days total (ends Dec. 1st 9am AEDT)
Days 1-4: Engine design and testing
Days 5-8: MVP: Getting basic VN laid down with at least placeholder art and sounds
Days 8-11: Iterating: adding more stuff from the feature list as needed, working on the mechanics, tweaking anything needed
Day 12: Final Polish
Day 12: Submission Day

Basic Concept:
A shortform horror VN about the protag discovering more than they should on an IRC, intended to be played for between 5-15 minutes (may be longer if things go well)

Elevator Pitch:
Set in the 90's in a suburban area, the player, their first weekend home alone in a while decides to research local legends by joining a cryptid IRC chat room and finds that the legends may be closer to home than anticipated, presented in a short form horror VN format

Art Style:
A realistic art style, depicting real life locations crunched down to 160*144@2bpp, attempting to breed familiarity in the player to relatable locations


Overview of features required for VN engine:
Scene loading from cartridge
ROM banking (need to research mapper carts)
Dialogue parsing and rendering
Resizable text boxes
Character rendering onto screen (maybe using OAM's? Max size is 48*48 if OAM based, OAM's would make transitions easier)
Dialogue choice's/menu dialogs
 ^needs to be affected by previous choices (have flags definable)
String storage for later (8 characters?)
Parsing string replacements in dialogue renderer (check for $name____ and replace with name strvar as needed)
Reversed palette text rendering with a flag
Scene transitions
Actor transitions
Sound effects playing
Music playing
Using DMA to copy data to speed it up for animations/loading (needs a HRAM handling function)

Gameplay loop example:
Transition from off
Display image of main menu
Press Start
Transition to an intro background
Play Dialogue
Ask for name, store name
Play more dialogue
Transition to a second background
Transition to show actor
Dialogue
Actor change state (from greeting to talking)
Dialogue
Actor change state (from talking to worried)
Dialogue
Transition to hide actor
...ETC...

General Engine Loop:
Globally owned:
    Music Handler
    Sound Handler
    Metasprite
    Story Flag Array
    Scene pointer

Main
Ticks scene pointer that's stored
    Scene (Scene owns the game loop)
        Actor (owns the loop during transitions)
        Dialogue (owns the loop when rendering out text)

Scene contents:
Data included in a bank that has space
have an initialise function where the background gets loaded

Immediate To-do:
*Implement OAM DMA copying routine for better metasprite handling
*Research and implement MBC5 mapping
*Test MBC5 mapping by placing a test image on a different bank and rendering it
Come up with a scene format that will work
*Test loading 6*6 metaobjects and moving them around to see how DMG handles that much data
Try flipping through animations with it (animation handler needed)
Implement a test scene without the correct formatting to ensure basic engine works
Slowly move the aboves entire setup into the decided format
Transitions that consist of either fading in/out (backgrounds) or sliding in/out from left/right (OAMs)
Research a scanline interrupt at the top of the dialogue box for rendering text using objects

Friday to-do:
Upgrade the text renderer to allow any size of text box via X/Y position instead of address
Two test scenes, one big test scene and a small one
Test Actors made in Aseprite ready to use as a template
Test backgrounds made in Aseprite ready for template usage
Metasprite Handlers (disable: sets the position way out of frame, sets all tiles to 0. destination move: used for transitions)


Needed for MVP:
Basic storyboard done
House layout done
Design bible finished
VN Engine that allows easy insertion of scenes and their data into a source file
Make an index of every scene and it's interactions?
A single route through the story, one ending, one path

Notes:

Features that are polish:
Colour images/support (Super Gameboy/Gameboy Colour, probably go for the CGB because it's more supported on emulators/hardware)
Branching paths
Additional endings
Extra character interactions
More areas of the house unlocked
Additional scenes/length
More sound effects
More animations/transition effects
