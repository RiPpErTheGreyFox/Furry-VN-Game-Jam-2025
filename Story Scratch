Story Board:

Chapter 1:
*introduction scene*
-show black background
You ever see something weird?

Something so unexplainable
That no one believes you?

That was me, almost 20 years ago
*end introduction*

*setting the scene*
-show kitchen no glass
This is where I
was living, near

college with all
the other deer in

the area, I guess
it felt like home

I always thought
it was weird that

similar species
would choose to

live near each
other, but

I guess it was
to feel safe

although I don't
feel safe around

other deer these
days, not anymore

-switch to roommate
-transition in from right
speaking of deer,
my room mate also

happened to be
one.

-switch to room mate talking
Hi there sleepy
head, I see you

are finally up
and about

you've slept all
day, it's almost

sunset! I was
about to head out

to a movie night.

-switch to room mate standing
I guess I'd be
getting the house

to myself for the
night for once.

-switch to room mate talking
Try not to have
any wild parties

while I'm gone
okay?

Byyeeeee!

-transition off screen to the right
-hide actor

yeah right, like
that'll ever

happen, not after
last night
*end setting the scene*

Scene Collection 2:
*walk around the house to get the layout*
well, I might as
well figure out

what to do for
the night

first I better
get the glass

from my room.

-fade to bedroom
Ah there it is.

-delay for a bit
I think another
night of checking

out IRC is the
plan for tonight

-switch to stairs down
god, these stairs
are gunna dump

me at the bottom
of them one day

-play stair footstep sounds
-switch to kitchen with glass

there we go,
time to go waste

my youth on the
internet, again.
*end walk around the house to get the layout*

*go up to room*
-fade to bedroom
-play stair footstep sounds

the early 'net
really was a wild

place, you could
find a chatroom

for anything,
that night though

I decided on a
cryptid chatroom

like I had many
times before

-switch to computer
*talk on IRC*
*$9832 is first line
D> Anyone got any
crazy stories
to tell tonight?
M> yeah, we were
talking about
the half deer
D> the half deer?
K> an evil spirit
for sure, not one
to mess with
*get told about le creachur*

Scene Collection 3:

- play glass break noise
*hear a noise*
Huh? What the
hell was that?
*go downstairs find broken glass*

- hide actor
It sounded like
something broke
- switch to kitchen with broken glass
- actor monster in the window
huh, that's weird
I must've put it

too close to the
edge, crap.

- fade to black
- play sound
- switch to kitchen no glass
*clean it up go back upstairs*
well that's all
sorted out

-switch to bedroom
I didn't think it
was that close to

the edge, wonder
if they know

anything about
what happened
*check computer again and say what happened*
- switch to computer
*IRC text*
-block of existing text
D> the half deer?
K> an evil spirit
for sure, not one
to mess with
M> not that any
of us should be
talking about it
F> y'all are
awful, y'know
that right?
-end block

D> somehow a
glass just broke
in my kitchen
K> oh hey,
guess that means
someone is being
paid a visit
*other person says oh good, maybe it's coming for you now instead*

Scene Collection 4:
-play footstep noise

Oh no, what the
hell is it now?
-switch to downstairs broken vase
What!?
Obviously I'm

just imagining
things, screw

this, I'm going
to bed...

- switch to laying in bed
*decide to go to bed because obviously imagining shit*
*laying in bed hear another noise*
Maybe I shouldn't
be reading creepy

stuff online,
it's probably not

good for me.

- play footstep sound again
Wait, the stairs?
Is my room-mate

home already?
*go look down stairs, monster is down there peeking around corner*

-transition from right into middle

see it!?

-actor roommate talking
See what?
A monster!?

What are you
talking about!?
*get back up into bedroom scene, talking to room mate*
*room mate doesn't believe*

*ending*
- fade back to black background
There's just one 
problem though,

It's still
hunting me today,

because it only
hunts people who

know about it.

Luckily, for me,
it usually only

hunts for whoever
was the last

person who heard
about it...

I sure hope you
got a friend to

tell the story to
next, either that

or learn to sleep
lightly...

*end ending*

*queue up title scene again*
