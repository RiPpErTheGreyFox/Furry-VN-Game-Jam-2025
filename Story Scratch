Room mate leaves for the weekend
Go on IRC and talk to someone about a monster
once monster has been talked about, weird noises and funny things start happening:
broken mug
open wardrobe
broken window
food left on floor
stomping down the hallway

give option to hide a few times

after a broken window give option to call the police or the roommate back
if police are called, then nothing happens
if room mate is called you see her get grabbed when she leaves again
